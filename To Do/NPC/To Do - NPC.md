## Refactor and Refine

- [x] Do we want to use a base sheet for all actors? No, because they all use different context from established sheets.
- [ ] Move `_inventory` and `_inventory-grid` styles to where they should go in the components
- [ ] Cannibalize as many `_character-sheet` styles as possible to where they should go in the components
- [ ] Extract a universal portait container that directs rounded styles and anything else that can be shareable
  - [ ] Cannibalize the global styles which are shared by NPC and Character profiles
- [ ] Consider converting `tooltip` to just `title` on text inputs
- [ ] Add prop obj `inputProps` on `TextInput`; move all input props that have direct equivalents in input elements out of the main component and into the inputProps obj and spread that on the underlying input
  - [ ] Ditto on `Select`
  - [ ] Ditto on `NumberInput`
- [ ] Have `TextInput` respect dtype "Number" and perform deltas as expected. The functionality currently lives in `submitText()`.
  - [ ] Consider refactoring so that callers of `submitText()` are adjusted to use `TextInput` or `NumberInput` as necessary.
- [ ] When an update operation fails, revert to the original value.
  - [x] Contenteditable
  - [ ] Textinput
  - [ ] Numberinput
  - [ ] Select
  - [ ] Checkbox
- [ ] `dtype` fields: formalize these as features of the input components, rather than just receiving them. Give the props names.
  - [ ] One way to go about this would be to have a universal function for preparing data for saving. It could take things like dtype, which would be set to known values.
  - [ ] Also figure out how to do the `draftValue` reversion on failed save approach without having to copy/paste it everywhere.
- [x] Default Tab applies to NPCs as well as PCs and Vehicles.
  - [x] Wire up for NPC
  - [x] Wire up for Vehicle
- [x] Lair Action Initiative input is not allowing me to clear it out. It always sets it to 0. Fix that.
- [x] "TIDY5E.EmptySection" / "This section is empty. Unlock the sheet to edit." banner should show in the player character sheet Inventory tab when allow-edit is false and there are no inventory sections shown
- [x] PC spellbook tab
  - [x] "DND5E.NoSpellLevels": "This character has no spellcaster levels, but you may add spells manually." if `filters.spellbook.size` is false / 0
  - [x] "TIDY5E.EmptySection" / "This section is empty. Unlock the sheet to edit." if allow-edit is false and there are no spells
- [x] PC features tab
  - [x] "TIDY5E.EmptySection" / "This section is empty. Unlock the sheet to edit." if allow-edit is false and there are no features and it's locked
- [x] Ditto PC effects tab
