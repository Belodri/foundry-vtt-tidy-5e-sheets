## Refactor and Refine

- [x] Do we want to use a base sheet for all actors? No, because they all use different context from established sheets.
- [ ] Move `_inventory` and `_inventory-grid` styles to where they should go in the components
- [ ] Cannibalize as many `_character-sheet` styles as possible to where they should go in the components
- [ ] Extract a universal portait container that directs rounded styles and anything else that can be shareable
  - [ ] Cannibalize the global styles which are shared by NPC and Character profiles
- [ ] Consider converting `tooltip` to just `title` on text inputs
- [ ] Add prop obj `inputProps` on `TextInput`; move all input props that have direct equivalents in input elements out of the main component and into the inputProps obj and spread that on the underlying input
  - [ ] Ditto on `Select`
  - [ ] Ditto on `NumberInput`
- [ ] Have `TextInput` respect dtype "Number" and perform deltas as expected. The functionality currently lives in `submitText()`.
  - [ ] Consider refactoring so that callers of `submitText()` are adjusted to use `TextInput` or `NumberInput` as necessary.
- [ ] When an update operation fails, revert to the original value.
  - [x] Contenteditable
  - [ ] Textinput
  - [ ] Numberinput
  - [ ] Select
  - [ ] Checkbox
