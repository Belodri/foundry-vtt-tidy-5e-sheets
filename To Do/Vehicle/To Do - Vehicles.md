### Action Thresholds

From "Galley" in GoS:

> On its turn, the galley can take **3 actions**, choosing from the options below. It can take only **2 actions if it has fewer than forty crew** and only **1 action if it has fewer than twenty**. It can't take these actions if it has **fewer than three crew**.
