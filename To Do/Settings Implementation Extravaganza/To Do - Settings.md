## Refine

- [x] HP Overlay - set pointer-events to none on `.death-saves`; set pointer-events to auto on `.death-saves > *`
- [x] Carve out a shared base type for all sheet contexts which contains universal settings
  - [x] ~~allowEdit~~ now rolled into editable
  - [x] lockSensitiveFields
  - [x] editable - this should combine the composite allowEdit and the "editable" field provided by dnd5e context
    - ... or should it replace allowEdit altogether?
- [x] üêû Click Str > Click Ability Check > Click Normal - notice that the chat message doesn't tell what kind of ability it is.
- [x] üêû Update Search Filters
  - [x] The placeholder text should match the tab name
  - [x] The placeholder text should user the faded / secondary color, while the text should use the primary font color.
  - [x] Test it
- [x] Make SHEET_TYPE_CHARACTER, SHEET_TYPE_NPC, and SHEET_TYPE_VEHICLE constants and update all usages.
- [x] Extract "useRoundedPortraitStyle" to ActorSheetContext
- [x] Make SPELL_PREPARATION_MODE_XYZ constants and update all usages.
- [x] Honor game setting "Disable Experience Tracking" on our sheets
- [x] Observers / Limited users should not be allowed to click configure buttons or make rolls.
- [ ] üêû When changing sheet permissions from observer/owner to limited, half the sheet changes while the other half with the header and tab strip remain intact. It should refresh the entire sheet.
- [ ] Find anchor-tag-based icon buttons; replace with actual buttons
  - `.icon-button` is for icon buttons
  - `.transparent-button` is for buttons that just want the button content and not the button background, border, etc.
  - `.item-list-button` for buttons that appear in the classic controls item list.
  - [ ] Replace each one and test
  - [ ] Ensure disable logic is honored
- [x] Convert all `<BlockTitle />` elements to contain buttons. Should the h4 be a button, or should it be an h4? Can an h4 contain a button and it be meaningful to a screen reader?

## Implement ALL the Settings! üëè

Test and verify that each setting is correctly configured. It must work on load and adjust reactively on change when settings are adjusted.

> Important: Always verify that the setting adjusts from A->B AND from B->A in the same page lifetime.

Refine and improve any settings that compromise visual feedback and information for the same of functionality, e.g. the Locks remove proficiency buttons rather than disable them, when they should be simply preventing proficiency toggle cycling.

  - If a GM and setting turned on, always show classic controls
    - To accomplish this in an elegant way, use a specific boolean setting on the ActorSheetContext (to be renamed CharacterSheetContext) for `showAllEditOptions`, to be combined with `classicControlsEnabled` to determine if classic controls are shown at all and whether the full set of options is shown.
  - Missed a spot: right click menu doesn't provide all the options. That would also need to be handled.
    - Check for whether the user is a GM and, if so, override allow-edit if the option is enabled
- [x] "editEffectsGmOnlyEnabled"
  - Removes classic controls altogether for the player on the effects tab
  - When unlocked, shows red banner "Only your GM can edit this section."

## Review and determine next steps

- [x] "enableActionListOnFavoritePanel" - removed
  - Renders Action List from API and plunks it into Favorites area above favorites
  - Looking rough right now in the original module
  - Probably going to remove and then return to it when implementing Actions tab natively
- [x] "hbEnableUpcastFreeSpell" - removed
  - Based on discussion with the commission, remove this.
- [x] "hbSetFeaturesForUpcastFreeSpell" - removed
  - Based on discussion with the commission, remove this.
- [ ] "defaultActionsTab"
  - [ ] Restyle as simply the Default Character Sheet Tab and put in Character settings
  - [ ] Add similar settings to NPC and Vehicles
  - [ ] Upgrade tabs to be fully data-driven for this

## Specific setting notes

### `activeEffectsMarker`:

- For PCs only, look at all items for the PC (inventory, spells, ...?)
  - If the item has 1 or more effects a la `actor.items[...].effects.length`, then append this marker: `<span class="ae-marker" title="Item has active effects">√Ü</span>`
    - Note: need to localize the title, bud

Original impl:

```js
function markActiveEffects(app, html, data) {
  if (game.settings.get(CONSTANTS.MODULE_ID, 'activeEffectsMarker')) {
    let actor = app.actor;
    let items = data.actor.items;
    let marker = `<span class="ae-marker" title="Item has active effects">√Ü</span>`;
    for (let item of items) {
      debug(`tidy5e-sheet | markActiveEffects | item: ${item}`);
      if (item.effects.length > 0) {
        let id = item._id;
        debug(`tidy5e-sheet | markActiveEffects | itemId: ${id}`);
        html.find(`.item[data-item-id="${id}"] .item-name h4`).append(marker);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```scss
.ae-marker {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 1px 3px 0 3px;
  font-size: 12px;
  line-height: 15px;
  font-weight: 600;
  background: var(--t5e-warning-accent);
  color: var(--t5e-secondary-color);
  border-radius: 3px;
}
```
