From discord user SaltyJ:

I have only ever used the mods listed as compatible. Dont go crazy trying to please everyone. A clean rewrite of what we have is more than enough

Latest Tidy Update did this to our tools....The Horror:
(picture of messed up UI)

As i mentioned My main quibbles with Tidy atm aside from random broken things due to 2.2.x is the vehicle sheets. I use them ALOT in my naval campaign, So if you need feedback for that, let me know. Happy to playtest.

Well im down to point out the boo boos that exist in the current version when you get to that sheet.

If you need a use case for testing, also let me know.
I have multiple vehicles (ships) setup and ready for testing
that was at wasp and kgar
(picture of complex vehicle configuration)

Lots going on.
And because Crew is broken in Tidy, i have to slap it into the description:

Being able to slap actual actors and items into slots, and have the Ship actor interact with them would be....CEWEL
