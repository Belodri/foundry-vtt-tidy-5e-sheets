### Pile of TODOs

- [x] Use existing or create new tab control | made a really rough tabs control with relative ease
- [ ] Implement the tabs
  - [ ] Attributes
    - [x] Make a component
    - [ ] Functionality
    - [ ] Settings
    - [ ] Styles
      - [ ] `_mainTab.scss`
    - [ ] Favorites...
  - [ ] Inventory
    - [x] Make a component
    - [ ] Functionality
    - [ ] Settings
    - [ ] Styles
      - [ ] src_scss\partials_inventory-grid.scss
      - [ ] src_scss\partials_inventory.scss
  - [ ] Spellbook
    - [x] Make a component
    - [ ] Functionality
    - [ ] Settings
    - [ ] Styles
  - [ ] Features
    - [x] Make a component
    - [ ] Functionality
    - [ ] Settings
    - [ ] Styles
- [x] Implement default tab
- [ ] Visual bug (existing): when any character detail field is too long in Biography top-notes for a PC, it will blow out the layout. Consider CSS grid as a replacement. Test carefully on all the major browsers. Also just consider inputs instead of contenteditable fields?
- [ ] Consider consolidating sheet initial value / cacheable content into single objects to pass down to the target component. Values include things like scrollTop map, currentTab sheet parameter, and any other sheetparameters that need to be cached for maintaining visual integrity between submissions / sheet refreshes.

## Exhaustion

- [x] HTML
- [x] SCSS
- [x] exhaustion on hover option
- [x] exhaustion hidden on 0 option
- [x] exhaustion note styles? no longer a feature; remove vestiges
- [ ] Add the custom exhaustion code; see [exhaustion script](./src/exhaustion.ts)
- [ ] Ferret out / expand these todos

## Security

- [ ] Port the functionality of `applyLocksCharacterSheet()`
- [ ] Port the functionality of `applyLocksNpcSheet()`
- [ ] Port the functionality of `applyLocksVehicleSheet()`
- [ ] Port the functionality of `applyLocksItemSheet()`

## Modules

Evaluate module integration and think about better (API-centric) ways to support other modules. Require the module developers to interface with Tidy if they wish to add things to the sheet. I will NOT match the structure of the D&D 5e default sheets.

- [ ] src_scss_modules.scss
- [ ] src_scss\dark_dark-modules.scss

> **Note**
> The system won't let the user actually make any changes to the character sheet when it's not editable to that user. This is only to help prevent frustration.

## Misc for the main character sheet

- [ ] Review `setSheetClasses()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `editProtection()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `addClassList()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `toggleTraitsList()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `checkDeathSaveStatus()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `abbreviateCurrency()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `spellAttackMod()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `addFavorites(, position)` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `countAttunedItems()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `countInventoryItems()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `markActiveEffects()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `spellSlotMarker()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `hideStandardEncumbranceBar()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `applyLazyMoney()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Review `applySpellClassFilterActorSheet()` and determine how this affects the player sheet
- [ ] Figure out what game.modules.get("character-actions-list-5e") module is, and how do we leverage it here with graceful fallback?
  - [ ] Moreover, how do we create a clear pipeline for supporting various modules?

## Reorganization

- [ ] Move the positioning styles to the portrait component or general styles, and apply them via cssClass to impose positioning that is relevant to the parent component (the portrait component)

## Step by step

- [x] Make proof of concept with svelte
- [x] Exercise some core functionality
  - [x] Rolling
  - [x] Editing data and having it persist
- [x] Global SCSS configured that is scoped to `.tidy5e-kgar`
- [ ] Figure out how flags and settings work
  - [x] Reread this https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/handling-data and compare it to Tidy5e's approach
  - [ ] https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/api/flags
  - [ ] https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/api/settings
- [x] Can the svelte view leverage prosemirror? YES.
- [x] Use context API to provide sheet functions: skipped this. Not enough pain yet to introduce context API.
- [x] Set up project constants for handling T5EK flags
- [x] Create a settings object that contains the data for registering the settings and a typed getter
- [x] Implement "Tidy5e KGar Sheet" Game Settings tracer bullet
  - [x] Add section to Game Settings
  - [x] Add setting for color theme
  - [x] Add button for Sheet Settings
  - [x] Add "Save Changes" button with icon
  - [x] Changes should be instantaneously displayed on open sheets (might need to use a svelte store for this)
  - [ ] Stub out the main sheet header
    - [x] Make a component for the Ability Score Block and reuse
    - [x] Make it fully functional
    - [ ] Stub TS types and resolve TS errors
    - [ ] Encapsulate and organize
    - [ ] Account for TODOs about implementing things
  - [ ] Apply styles to make the header look verbatim like the original
  - [ ] Add existing CSS variables
  - [ ] Make dark mode a simple update to the variables, rather than a totally different class.
- [x] Register all settings
- [x] Fill out the main settings dialog
- [x] Implement "Tidy5e KGar Sheet Settings" dialog tracer bullet
  - [x] Create dialog
  - [x] Add Default Player Sheet Width setting
  - [x] Add "Save Changes" button with icon
  - [x] Changes should be instantaneously displayed on open sheets (trigger a render of all open sheets) - ðŸ’ª it required awaiting the settings updates when saving changes
- [x] Fill out remainder of settings
- [ ] Create custom tab component
  - [ ] Use show/hide scheme so that scroll and state are remembered
  - [ ] Rethink how to emit scroll position to the sheet so that rerenders and submissions can feed the position back through
- [ ] Update scroll position
  - [ ] Track locally to the current sheet instance; continue to pass through in the same manner as before
  - [ ] Remember the last selected tab and that tab's scroll position so that rerenders and submissions do not cause scroll jumping
  - [ ] Use a custom tab component that leverages hidden content so that scroll is remembered while actively using the sheet
  - [ ] Do not use flags
  - [ ] Support remembering scroll between rerenders, submissions, etc.
- [ ] Convert sheet settings to use svelte view, and then make it a lot nicer and more convenient.
- [ ] Properly lock down all gm-only settings
- [ ] Use semantic HTML for the sheets (how do I utilize header, section, article, nav, etc.?)
- [ ] ... next steps
- [ ] Implement `editGmAlwaysEnabled`
- [ ] Implement `editEffectsGmOnlyEnabled`

## Cross-Cutting

- [ ] Implement info card
  - [ ] src_scss\partials_item-info-card.scss
  - [ ] Game Settings
- [ ] Reimplement Favorites visualization - [ ] Psst: src_scss\partials_favorites.scss

  - [ ] Player Character
    - [ ] GM
    - [ ] Unlimited
    - [ ] Limited
  - [ ] NPC
    - [ ] GM
    - [ ] Unlimited
    - [ ] Limited
    - [ ] Favorites system
    - [ ] src_scss_npc.scss
  - [ ] Vehicle
    - [ ] GM
    - [ ] Unlimited
    - [ ] Limited
    - [ ] Favorites system
    - [ ] src_scss_vehicle.scss
  - [ ] Item
    - [ ] Favorites system
    - [ ] src_scss_items.scss (they import at top-level, and there's apparently a dedicated item sheet)
- [ ] Reimplement the misc templates
  - [ ] Favorites
    - [ ] Item
    - [ ] Template
  - [ ] Items
    - [ ] spell class filter form
- [ ] Reimplement game settings integration

- [ ] Remember scroll position for every tab in an open sheet, and return to that position when navigating to a tab; default 0
  - [ ] Stretch: can we remember scroll top for a given sheet when closing the sheet and reopening?
    - [ ] What about when reloading Foundry client?
- [ ] All open Tidy sheets should be re-rendered when options are updated
- [ ] Exhaustion is a whole feature unto itself with hooks to integrate with midi QoL. Factor this integration back in.
- [ ] Do I need `data-dtype`?
- [ ] Evaluate and determine if there is still useful info in these files
  - [ ] src_scss\tidy5e.scss
  - [ ] src\css\tidy5e-dark.scss
  - [ ] src_scss_sheet.scss

> Most recent breakages in Tidy5e sheets were related to magic HTML conventions that hook into invisible jquery wire-ups. You have to go read through the core HBS's for character sheets. Since you're already there, skip the limitations imposed by trying to recreate their sheet and instead use the public API. After all the public API provides deprecation notices, whereas the 5e sheet can just suddenly be structured differently on a new version. Not much they will do about that.

## Stretch

- [ ] Explore touch-friendly UX options
  - [ ] More surface area to tap
  - [ ] Larger icons
- [ ] Option macros
  - [ ] Desktop mode
  - [ ] Tablet mode
    - [ ] Turns on touch-friendly UI layout and rearranges relevant content on tabs like Attributes, biography, journal
- [ ] Explore drag-n-drop UI options for where to put things on relevant tabs like Attributes tab with the Proficiencies, skills, resources, etc
  - [ ] Be able to specify a default in sheet settings
  - [ ] Be able to do it live on the sheet in realtime and save as default or just for the current sheet
- [ ] Explore how to test compatibility via [FoundryVTT Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/felddy/foundryvtt)
- [ ] Explore how to perform Automated UI testing with something like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/app)
- [x] Explain levels of exhaustion effects for each individual exhaustion button
- [ ] Study a11y and apply it to the forms
- [ ] Identify all remaining static color styles and extract them meaningfully into CSS variables
- [ ] Import/Export custom color themes ðŸ’ª
- [ ] Sheet settings: Use non-Foundry-module color picker (Svelte has a nice one) for setting CSS colors
- [ ] UI test idea - create automated walkthrough of the application which provides screenshots of relevant areas with relevant features toggled on and off. This should go into a markdown report with the screenshots. It should report any console errors as well.
